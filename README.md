# Livery F1 2022 -> 2023 Season

I was excited to see a lot of the livery reveals this year for the F1, so thought it would be fun to put together a quick site to be able to scrub between the liveries and see the differences from year to year.

Build elm app for comparison page with:

```
$ elm make src/Main.elm --output=compare.html
```
